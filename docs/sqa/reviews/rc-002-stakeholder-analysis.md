## Checklist Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Power/Interest grid is filled for every stakeholder, with no gaps or unclassified entries | Pass | S01, S02, S03 each have Power, Interest and Quadrant |
| 2 | Each stakeholder is assigned a unique, stable ID (e.g. S01-S11 style) reusable for RACI assignments in other artifacts | Pass | IDs S01 to S03 are unique and used for ownership in the plan and milestones |
| 3 | Roles and organizational context are defined with explicit Power and Interest levels, not just narrative description | Pass | Roles, organisation, Power and Interest levels are in the table |
| 4 | Communication needs (channel, frequency, deliverable type) are mapped to project phases or milestones | Pass | Communication table names channel, frequency, deliverable and milestone |
| 5 | Conflicting stakeholder interests are identified with documented mitigation or resolution strategies | Pass | One conflict (requests library against no runtime dependency) with a mitigation |
| 6 | Stakeholder concerns are explicitly traced to Business Case objectives | Pass | Business Goal Alignment maps each concern to a [BC-001] objective |
| 7 | Primary concerns are expressed in both business language and a recognized quality-attribute mapping (e.g. FURPS+) | Pass | Concerns table maps each concern to a FURPS+ attribute |
| 8 | Document is understandable and navigable by non-technical stakeholders reviewing their own entry | Pass | Short tables in plain language; a stakeholder finds their row at once |

## Language and Domain Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Metadata table has a `Language` row and a `Domain` row, and neither is a placeholder | Pass | SA-001 Metadata has `Language` = en and `Domain` = it |
| 2 | `Language` is a BCP 47 code and `Domain` is a value from the registry's domain list | Pass | `en` is a BCP 47 code; `it` is in the registry's domain list |
| 3 | The content (prose and table cells) is written in the stated language | Pass | All prose and table cells are English |
| 4 | The register matches the one the registry gives for the artifact type | Pass | Register fits the registry's row for the type |
| 5 | Domain terms are the PO terms of the domain's dictionary, with no synonyms | Pass | the document uses `quote` and `quote source` as DICT-001 defines them |
| 6 | Metadata keys, section headings, IDs and statuses are in English | Pass | Metadata keys, headings, IDs and statuses are English |
| 7 | No translated twin (`<name>.<language>.md`) exists beside the document | Pass | No `*.en.md` or other translated twin exists in `docs/` |
| 8 | A change of language or domain since the previous accepted version has a Version History row and was reviewed again | Pass | Initial version; language and domain never changed |
| 9 | A reviewer competent in the domain, and in the language, has confirmed that the domain terms are used correctly | Pass | Reviewer is the AI as stand-in for S01 (not independent); English and the IT domain are read without a second reviewer |
| 10 | Abbreviations are spelled out on first use, in the stated language | Pass | Abbreviations are spelled out on first use or are named standards |

## Overall Verdict

Go — all Mandatory criteria pass; the review is autonomous and not independent, so S01 can challenge it in the final summary.
